**File Operations in C**: A Comprehensive Implementation
Introduction
File handling is an essential aspect of programming that enables data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. In C, file operations allow users to work with data beyond the program’s runtime, making it useful for long-term storage. This project demonstrates how to perform file operations such as creating, reading, writing, and appending data to a file using C programming. The project is structured to be modular, efficient, and user-friendly, making it an excellent learning resource for students and beginners.

Project Overview
The project provides a menu-driven C program that performs the following operations on a text file:

Write to a File – Creates a file (if not already existing) and writes data to it.
Read from a File – Opens an existing file and displays its contents.
Append to a File – Adds additional data to an already existing file.
Exit – Terminates the program.
Each operation is implemented as a separate function to enhance modularity and maintainability. The program handles errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.
